This repository contains projects that I have completed. 
Huffman is a project where I use a Huffman encoding scheme to compress and decompress files. Evil Hangman is a version of Hangman where the word is not chosen till the computer needs to. After inputting a character, the computer will decrease the pool of words to chose from and will finally choose when no options are left. 
Connect Four is a standard game of Connect Four between to players. 
The Football Prediction project includes a web scraper that took statistics from Pro Football Reference and was put into a model that would try to predict the outcomes of NFL games. This project was done in Python and includes Python libraries, such as Pandas and BeautifulSoup, and uses a Random Forest model as the way to analyze data. 
The Memory Manager folder contains an implementation of how memory is managed in a program. It resembles how an OS allocates memory for a program and then frees the memory used. This is done in C.
