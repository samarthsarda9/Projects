# JavaProjects

This repository contains projects that I have completed. Included are: Huffman, Evil Hangman, and Connect Four. Huffman is a project where I use a Huffman encoding scheme to compress and decompress files. Evil Hangman is a version of Hangman where the word is not chosen till the computer needs to. After inputting a character, the computer will decrease the pool of words to chose from and will finally choose when no options are left. Connect Four is a standard game of Connect Four between to players. The Fantasy Football web-scraper is a simple web-scraper developed using the BeautifulSoup library in Python to collect fantasy football statistics from a website. The compiled data is then put into a .csv file to be used later.
